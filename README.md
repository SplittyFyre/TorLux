## TorLux

A decentralized, encrypted, anonymous, amnesic instant messaging application.
(sortof like TorChat, except strives to be much more secure and convenient)
##
TorLux works in a decentralized system by having each client open a hidden service, which listens for incoming messages. So far, a TorLux session can be initiated by sharing a join token and only works with two people. Support for multi-person chat is a possible future feature :)
